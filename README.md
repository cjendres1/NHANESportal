Access Demographic Info from the CDC NHANES database

This is a simple shiny app that may be used to retrieve demographic info from the CDC 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Database.

The CDC NHANES project <http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/about_nhanes.htm> is a program of studies 
designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.
The data are made freely available to the public and are often used for research. A large variety
of examination, lab, questionnaire, and demographic data are available.

In this shinyApp utility we are focusing on retrieving basic demographic data.
The four data categories are gender, age, ethnicity, and marital status. The
shinyApp allows the user to retrieve and summarize the data that have been
collected since 2001. The utility could be modified easily to retrieve, display,
and download, and data from the NHANES site.

The app is accessible here : <https://cjendres1.shinyapps.io/BrowseNHANESdemographics/>
